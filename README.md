# Autarki
A NetLogo model designed to study the behavior of rational players in distributed consensus, which in turn translates to the security and reliability of the entire system.

It simulates a voting-based consensus protocol for Blockchain applications that require **completeness** assurance. This is the property of all authentic and valid blocks presented for consensus being accepted and included in the distributed-ledger in their correct chronological order.

The model allows users to observe how a rational peer's decision for self-protection investment would differ when various parameters that concern them are altered.

> Autarky is the characteristic of self-sufficiency, usually applied to societies, communities, states, and their economic systems - ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarky))
>
> We have stylized this word in naming our model, which evaluates conditions under which a peer community will be able to withstand denial-of-service attacks from an adversary.


## Running the simulation

1. Download and Install NetLogo (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml)
2. Open `autarki.nlogo` file through the NetLogo Application. Double Clicking the file would also work.
3. Several command-line scripts are included in `conf/` folder as a sample for an increased amount of simulation runs.

## Understanding the model

After opening the model from the NetLogo application, you can refer to the `Info` tab for a thorough introduction of the simulation. However, the terminology would be better understood with the accompanying research **Security And Reliability Of Rational Players In Distributed Consensus**, which is included as a PDF file alongside the simulation code.
